# matplotlib-challenge

A new pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications called Pymaceuticals, Inc. has recently begun screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In their most recent animal study, 249 mice with SCC tumors received treatment with various drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

This study aimed to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

In this challenge, I need to generate all of the tables, figures, and a top-level summary of the study results required for the technical report of the clinical study. 

See my observation about the results at the top of the notebook (`main.ipynb`)

I received feedback from a tutor about my for loops and help on how to highlight the outliers in a box plot.

To round the correlation, I used cell 292 from this Matplotlib challenge:
